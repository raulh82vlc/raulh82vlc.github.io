# Raúl Hernández López / Raul Hernandez Lopez
*Experienced Software Engineer - focused on Android & Kotlin*

### Overview
I would like to introduce myself as a continuous learner apart from being an experienced Software Engineer (10+ Years Experience), specialised on the Android platform (9 YE) & the Kotlin language (6 YE).

Moreover, I am a public speaker when I get the chance for it, so far I've participated like an international speaker in different events like podcasts, meetups or conferences such as Droidcon: Berlin'23, UK'19 & '17, Spain'19, GOTO Copenhagen'19 or Remote's such as EMEA & APAC'20 or FOSDEM'21; Podcasts such as AndroidDevPodcast Jul'20 or #ChimichurriCode Jun'21; Meetups such as Londroid April'17 or Virtual Meetups such as Kotlin London Dec'20 & Jun'21, MADG Spain Nov'20 RockNDroid Vigo May'21. I write some articles in Medium (linked from this blog too), typically not technical at the end of the year to summarize the past year and technical ones too.

I am from Valencia (Spain) originally, where we use to love paella and horchata, nowadays I am also living and working (from home) in Valencia (Spain). Nevertheless, I've also lived/worked in London (UK) and Antwerp (Belgium).

I do love travelling when I can, listening music metal/rock gigs, reading tech/no-tech books, hanging out with friends, a very cold beer or running sometime.
